## BSCSiphon
 Simple Tool to Siphon funds from a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) account meant for use with compromised accounts that continue to generate revenue.
 
---- 
Normally I'm a firm believer of not putting your private key into ANYTHING. However this tool is meant to be used by people who have already had their Private key or Seedphrase breached/phished.

Put your private key in and the new address you would like to siphon funds to.
Set a threshold (minimum is 0.002 to allow for gas) in BNB

Hit start Siphoning and leave the program running to see the funds transfer whenever the balance is greater than the threshold.

Hit the Button again to stop, or simply close the program. No Addresses are saved locally or anywhere else.
